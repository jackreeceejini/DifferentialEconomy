# DifferentialEconomy
A proposal for a new kind of global economic system where money is distributed to individuals, UBI style, at a given rate with respect to time

Phase 1: The first phase of this project would be to create code that demonstrates the idea of a
new kind of Global Economy I call DifferentialEconomy where people are given a tiny amount of 
money every second rather than a bulk sum like is being done during the Covid19 pandemic.

This tiny amount will be a universal basic income. The reason its differential is that it is not constant, 
and there are things an individual can do to increase how much is coming in per unit time.

As an example, if you are unemployed you could be receiving maybe $1000 dollars a month, this is 
$12000 a year. But with this new system of differential economy you could just have a tiny amount deposited
to your account every second of $0.000380469. Eventually every month this will amount to $1000 but it will
not be deposited at once. Now if you add a new source of income like maybe you start working, your employer 
will just add a small differential to your base income which is flat and guaranteed for everyone. With the 
new differntial you will now be earning more. As you add new income sources your differential increases, thus 
increasing your yearly income. 

Employers will not need to pay you bulk sums every month, week or two weeks, they will just add to your 
income differential, this will enable small businesses hire faster because you will not need a fixed amount 
of large capital to hire people.

The hourly pay rate is a great innnovation but the truth is that you do not receive your hourly rate everyday as you
work. Rather you receive a paycheck once a week or in two weeks depending on the arrangement. But with this new economic 
system you could be getting money comming in every second and you can decide to spend or to save. 

Taxation can be implemented by reserving a certain amount of your income differential to the IRS. 

This system will assure that everybody survives no matter the economic situation. $1000 a month is just a suggestion 
based on the current ideas about UBI being floated around. Governments can decide to set this base amount to anything 
they calculate will be the best.

Phase 2: This second phase will see a reimplementation of the code for real world deployment, this is when performance issues will 
be considered. The first implementation of the code will be more illustrative. So that people at all levels of experience
could read the code and understand the system. Phase 1 is basically experimentation of ideas on how such a future Global economy
could be designed.

Phase 3: If the idea grows successfully, then it will be time for real world experimentation in a Network. In Phase 1 and Phase 2 we
could experiment on Blockchain ideas to see if it will be appropriate for such a system. By Phase 3 everything is mature and 
ready for experimentation via the release of an experimental build to the public. With the data obtained on the real world activity
of the project we could work towards Phase 4

Phase 4: In this phase the system is mature and ready for us to start pitching the idea to Governments and Institutions around
the world.
